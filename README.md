# Zeo
Simple C# application to get a list of released horriblesubs animes from rss feeds.

It uses [HorribleSubs](http://horriblesubs.info/) rss feed to get the animes that are being followed and [Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si/) feed to do a specific search. 
<sub><sup>because horriblesubs doesn't have a search function</sup></sub>

You must specify where to save the downloaded episodes and where they were downloaded to if you want the program to organize the files. The folder where your torrent application downloads your files must be diferent than the one specified in the program.

You can open your favourite torrent program just by setting it's path aswell.

Also it's a lot of messy code.
